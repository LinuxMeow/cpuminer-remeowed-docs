Nano Node and Protocol Documentation Welcome! This documentation is focused on helping developers understand the Nano protocol, as well as setup, maintain and build on top of the Nano node. Details of how this documentation has been arranged are below: Section Details Audience What is Nano? Take a high-level tour - this is a great place to learn about how Nano is uniquely suited to being a global digital currency. All users, node operators, developers Running a Node Set up a Nano node to manage the ledger, create and publish blocks and participate in consensus. Node operators, developers Integration Guides Learn practical concepts, structures and features for building wallets, payment systems and other services on the Nano network. Developers Commands Explore an exhaustive list of interaction methods for the node via RPC and CLI. Node operators, developers Protocol Design Dig deeper into the design and behaviors driving the protocol, including the election process, peering mechanics and more. Developers Node Implementation Details of the Nano Foundation managed node implementation of the protocol. Developers Releases Review past node releases and get details about the features coming soon in new releases. Everyone Glossary Commonly used terms throughout the documentation and Nano ecosystem.
